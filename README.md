This analysis was originally made as part of a nanodegree program in [Fundamentals on Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree), from Udacity. I am expanding it as I am continuing learning.

Analysis\_Bay\_Area\_Bike\_Share.html - Contains the analysis.

Analysis\_Bay\_Area\_Bike\_Share.ipynb - Main project file.

Data is split among six files, organized into three sets of four files
each. Prefixing each set is one of three datestamps, showing the end month for
each data collection period (201402, 201408, 201508). Suffixes for each file
indicate contents:

\*\_README.txt - Information about contents of data files.

\*\_station\_data.csv - Basic information about station locations and
capacities.

\*\_trip\_data.csv - Information about each trip taken using the bike share
system.

All the Data is then summarised in one single file: babs\_y1\_y2\_summary.csv
